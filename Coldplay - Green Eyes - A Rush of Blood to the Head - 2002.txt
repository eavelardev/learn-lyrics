[Verse 1]
Honey, you are a rock upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand
The green eyes
Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

[Chorus]
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter now I've met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

[Verse 2]
Honey, you are the sea upon which I float
And I came here to talk, I think you should know
That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their minds

[Chorus]
Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I've met you
And honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes
Green eyes

[Outro]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
