[Troy, Gabriella, Both]

[Verse 1]
Livin' in my own world, didn't understand
That anything can happen, when you take a chance
I never believed in (Ohh) what I couldn't see
I never opened my heart (Ohh) to all the possibilities, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here, tonight

[Chorus:]
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart (Feel in my heart) the start of something new
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Now who'd have ever thought that, mmm
We'd both be here tonight? Oh
Yeah, and the world looks so much brighter (Brighter, brighter)
Oh, with you by my side (By my side)

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
I know it for real

[Chorus:]
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart the start of something new

[Bridge:]
I never knew that it could happen, 'til it happened to me
Oh, yeah
I didn't know it before, but now it's easy to see, oh

[Chorus:]
It's the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart

That it's the start of something new
It feels so right (so right) to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes (Lookin' in your eyes)
I feel in my heart (Feel in my heart)
The start of something new (The start of something new)
The start of something new
