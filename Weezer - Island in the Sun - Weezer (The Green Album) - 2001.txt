[Hook]
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Verse 1]
When you're on a holiday
You can’t find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

[Pre-Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain

[Hook]
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Verse 2]
When you're on a golden sea
You don’t need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

[Pre-Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain

[Chorus]
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

[Hook]
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip

[Pre-Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain

[Chorus]
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

[Outro]
Hip hip
Hip hip
We'll never feel bad anymore (Hip hip)
No no (Hip hip)
Hip hip
We'll never feel bad anymore (Hip hip)
No no (Hip hip)
Hip hip
We'll never feel bad anymore
